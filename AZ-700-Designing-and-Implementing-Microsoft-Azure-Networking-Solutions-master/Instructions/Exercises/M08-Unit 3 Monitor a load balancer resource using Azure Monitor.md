# M08-Unit 3 Monitor a load balancer resource using Azure Monitor

## Exercise scenario

In this exercise, you will create an internal load balancer for the fictional Contoso Ltd organization. Then you will create a Log Analytics workspace, and use Azure Monitor Insights to view information about your internal load balancer. You will view the Functional Dependency View, then view detailed metrics for the load balancer resource, and view resource health information for the load balancer. Finally, you will configure the load balancer's diagnostic settings to send metrics to the Log Analytics workspace you created.

The diagram below illustrates the environment you will be deploying in this exercise.

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Select **Create**.

## Task 2: Create the load balancer

In this section, you will create an internal Standard SKU load balancer. The reason we are creating a Standard SKU load balancer here in the exercise, instead of a Basic SKU load balance, is for later exercises that require a Standard SKU version of the load balancer.

1. On the Azure home page, in the search bar, enter **Load Balancer**

1. Select **Create Load Balancer**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, use the information in the table below to create the load balancer.

   | Subnet                | **myBackendSubnet**      |
   | IP address assignment | **Dynamic**              |

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Select **Create**.

## Task 3: Create a backend pool

The backend address pool contains the IP addresses of the virtual NICs connected to the load balancer.

1. On the Azure portal home page, select **All resources**, then select on **myIntLoadBalancer** from the resources list.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Backend pools**, and then select **Add**.

1. On the **Add backend pool** page, enter the information from the table below.

   | **Setting**     | **Value**            |

   | Backend Pool Configuration   | **NIC** |

1. Select **Add**.

   ![Show backend pool created in load balancer](../media/create-backendpool.png)

## Task 4: Create a health probe

The load balancer monitors the status of your app with a health probe. The health probe adds or removes VMs from the load balancer based on their response to health checks. Here you will create a health probe to monitor the health of the VMs.

1. From the **Backend pools** page of your load balancer, under **Settings**, select **Health probes**, then select **Add**.

1. On the **Add health probe** page, enter the information from the table below.

   | **Setting**         | **Value**         |
   | ------------------- | ----------------- |
   | Name                | **myHealthProbe** |
   | Protocol            | **HTTP**          |
   | Port                | **80**            |
   | Path                | **/**             |
   | Interval            | **15**            |

1. Select **Add**.

   ![Show health probe created in load balancer](../media/create-healthprobe.png)

## Task 5: Create a load balancer rule

A load balancer rule is used to define how traffic is distributed to the VMs. You define the frontend IP configuration for the incoming traffic and the backend IP pool to receive the traffic. The source and destination port are defined in the rule. Here you will create a load balancer rule.

1. From the **Backend pools** page of your load balancer, under **Settings**, select **Load balancing rules**, then select **Add**.

1. On the **Add load balancing rule** page, enter the information from the table below.

   | **Setting**            | **Value**                |
   | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
   | Name                   | **myHTTPRule**           |
   | IP Version             | **IPv4**                 |
   | Frontend IP address    | **LoadBalancerFrontEnd** |
   | Protocol               | **TCP**                  |
   | Port                   | **80**                   |
   | Backend port           | **80**                   |
   | Backend pool           | **myBackendPool**        |
   | Health probe           | **myHealthProbe**        |
   | Session persistence    | **None**                 |
   | Idle timeout (minutes) | **15**                   |
   | Floating IP            | **Disabled**             |

1. Select **Add**.

   ![Show load balancing rule created in load balancer](../media/create-loadbalancerrule.png)

## Task 6: Create backend servers

In this section, you will create three VMs for the backend pool of the load balancer, add the VMs to the backend pool, and then install IIS on the three VMs to test the load balancer.

1. In the Azure portal, select the Cloud Shell icon (top right). If necessary, configure the shell.  
    + Select **PowerShell**.
    + Select **No Storage Account required** and your **Subscription**, then select **Apply**.
    + Wait for the terminal to create and a prompt to be displayed. 

1. On the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Manage files** icon, in the drop-down menu, select **Upload** and upload the following files **azuredeploy.json** and **azuredeploy.parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory one by one from the source folder **F:\Allfiles\Exercises\M08**.

1. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the virtual network, subnets, and VMs needed for this exercise:

   >**Note**: You will be prompted to provide an Admin password.

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "IntLB-RG"

   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile azuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile azuredeploy.parameters.json
   ```
  
    > **Note:** This will take several minutes to deploy.

## Task 7: Add VMs to the backend pool

1. On the **Service Health&gt;Service issues** page, in the left-hand menu select **Resource Health**.

1. On the **Service Health&gt;Resource health** page, in the **Resource type** drop-down list, scroll down the list and select **Load balancer**.

   ![Access Service Health>Resource Health for load balancer resource](../media/resource-health-1.png)

1. Then select the name of your load balancer from the list.

1. The **Resource health** page will identify any major availability issues with your load balancer resource. If there are any events under the **Health History** section, you can expand the health event to see more detail about the event. You can even save the detail about the event as a PDF file for later review and for reporting.

   ![Service Health>Resource health view](../media/resource-health-2.png)

## Task 13: Configure diagnostic settings

1. On the Azure portal home page, select **Resource groups**, then select the **IntLB-RG** resource group from the list.

1. On the **IntLB-RG** page, select the name of the **myIntLoadBalancer** load balancer resource in the list of resources.

1. Under **Monitoring**, select **Diagnostic settings**, then select **Add diagnostic setting**.

   ![Diagnostic settings>Add diagnostic setting button highlighted](../media/diagnostic-settings-1.png)

1. On the **Diagnostic setting** page, in the name box, enter **myLBDiagnostics**.

1. Select your subscription from the list, then select **myLAworkspace (westus)** from the workspace drop-down list.

1. Select **Save**.

   ![Diagnostic setting page for load balancer](../media/diagnostic-settings-2.png)

## Clean up resources

>**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. On the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'IntLB-RG' -Force -AsJob
   ```

>**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
